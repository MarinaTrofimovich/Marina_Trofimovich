# [Project 1. Bank customer churn prediction](https://github.com/MarinaTrofimovich/Projects)

The project solved the problem of predicting the churn of bank customers. Using churned customers as a means of understanding why customers are leaving, we analyzed how and when churn occurs in a customer's life cycle with the bank and predicted the customer's churn. In the future the bank can use that information to put into place preemptive measures.
